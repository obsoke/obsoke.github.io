I just moved the entire site over to a <a title="Linode" href="http://www.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a> VPS. I have always used shared web hosting in the past, and while it has been cheap I have been interested in having a bit more control over my web server. I have only been with Linode for a day but so far they seem pretty cool! They have a lovely user interface to control your VPS, including a DNS control panel and virtual machine management. I wonder what other applications I can run on the server... anyone up for a permanent Quake 3 Arena server?
