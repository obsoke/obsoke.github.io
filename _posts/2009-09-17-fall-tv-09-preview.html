<p>Well, this blog has been neglected. I'll try to change that as I plan on getting my own domain soon; I'll probably end up moving the blog to my new site. Anyway, in the meantime, these are the premiere dates for the next season (or special in the case of Doctor Who) for Fall '09, starting with Fringe/The Office tonight. I'm not so interested in The Office but Fringe!</p>
