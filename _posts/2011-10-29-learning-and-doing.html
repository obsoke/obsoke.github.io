I have been working at my co-op job for the past two months, and learning a lot in the process. There has been a wide variety of projects for me to do such as: improving my JavaScript, JSON and AJAX skills by writing a <a title="JavaScrptMVC" href="http://javascriptmvc.com/" target="_blank">JavaScriptMVC</a> plug-in that interacted with a <a title="Riak" href="http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/" target="_blank">Riak</a> cluster, learning Ruby and <a title="Gherkin" href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin" target="_blank">Gherkin</a> by writing automated QA tests with the <a title="Cucumber" href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a> testing framework, testing some RESTful APIs and a variety of other tasks. It has been a lot of fun learning about all these technologies and understanding how a company selling a SaaS goes abput its day-to-day business.

Outside of work, I have been busy with personal projects. I started work on a JavaScript-based Lifestreaming script. It will aggregate your online activity from different services into one feed. The source code will be available on my github repo as soon as I feel it is ready to be released. I have also been working on my Brickbreaker clone, which is my next game project,and my last remake before I start some original projects. I managed to get some real art for my game this time around! The background was provided for free by a <a href="http://wish04.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">gentleman</a> off of reddit. The rest of the art was created by my lovely girlfriend. Thanks girlfriend!<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-455" title="Breakbricker Preview" src="http://dale.io/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/game_preview.png" alt="Preview image from my second game remake." width="1297" height="756" />
