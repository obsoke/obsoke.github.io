A month has passed since my last post, so I decided to write up a little update as promised. The repetitive strain injury in my forearms and hands has been subsiding over the last month, but I believe another month or so off will help even more. The whole reason I took this semester off of school in the first place was to give my hands time to heal so I might as well take full advantage of it before I start school again in May. I will not be making another post until I feel I am ready to start using the computer every day. Believe me, it has been very difficult! I have a lot of things to post about when I return.

I'd like to recommend a book before I finish this post. It is called <strong>Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs</strong> by Scott Meyers. <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1299006961&sr=8-1">Here</a> is the Amazon.ca link. I know the basics of C++ from school but this book offers advice on the best ways to use the language, and how to milk performance out of your code while keeping it readable. If you are interested in becoming a better C++ programmer, read it!
