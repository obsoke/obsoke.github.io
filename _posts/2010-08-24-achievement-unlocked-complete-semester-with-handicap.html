I just finished writing my final exam not too long ago, bringing my second semester in CPA at Seneca to a close. Before the semester began, I discovered that I had strained muscles and tendons in my hands and forearms, making last semester extremely difficult to complete. At the moment, I am trying to figure out whether I need to take a semester off in order for my hands to heal completely, or whether they will heal enough in the next two weeks so that I can start my third semester in September with no obstacles. Obviously, I would like to go back in September but it was difficult to put 100% of myself into my work with this condition this semester, so I may take it off to help myself in the long run.

I have barely played any games the whole semester which is quite depressing, especially since I have StarCraft 2 sitting on my hard drive barely touched. I plan on doing a lot of reading over the next few weeks though, both fiction and non-fiction. I recently bought an Amazon Kindle (the 6", WiFi-only one) which I should be receiving within the next few weeks. I have wanted an eReader for a while, simply because I really don't have space for more books at the moment and I don't enjoy reading off of my monitor. Here is a list of some of the books I plan to read:

<strong>Fiction</strong>
- "Neuromancer" by William Gibson
- "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card
- Neal Stephenson Books

<strong>Non-fiction</strong>
- Finish "The C Programming Language" by K&H
- "Simply JavaScript" by Kevin Yank
- "Core Techniques and Algorithms in Game Programming"
- Need a good C++ book

I am looking for suggestions for good books about C++, JavaScript,Python and game programming, so I would appreciate any suggestions!

Not being able to use my hands to do the things I love to do made me realize how much I took my hands for granted when they were working normally. I spent a lot of time thinking about the things I would do once my hands get back to peak performance, and taking up an instrument is on the list. I love both the piano and guitar, having played both at separate times in my life, but I'd like to pick up one instrument to master. Does anyone else play an instrument? How did you settle on learning to play one out of the many that exist? It is so hard to choose just one!

Aside from taking up an instrument, I plan on throwing myself into game development at full-throttle once my hands heal, as well as re-designing & re-arranging my blog and website. Until then... I'm on a mini-vacation! Hopefully I'll be back sooner rather than later...
