This week at the Tokyo Game Show, From Software showed off its newest game, "Project Dark". <a href="http://kotaku.com/5641393/yup-project-dark-is-basically-demons-souls-2">Kotaku got a hold of a trailer</a>, which seems to remind me of another game I played not too long ago...

Is this the sequel to Demon's Souls? The gameplay and art style leaves one to believe that it is. Demon's Souls was one of my favorite games to come out in 2009, even if it left me raging at the television on more than one occasion. Here's to more epic, hair-pulling moments!

If you own a PS3 and you never played the original, you should pick it up. It'll put some hair on your chest.
