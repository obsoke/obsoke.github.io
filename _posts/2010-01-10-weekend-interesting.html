Unfortunately, there will be no Doctor Who review. Perhaps when season five begins, I will start reviewing episodes but with my first semester in Computer Programming &amp; Analysis starting tomorrow, I'm afraid I didn't have the time! As a consolation prize, here are some links to cool stuff I found on internets this weekend.

» After the news that Rogers would not be upgrading the HTC Dream to a newer version of Android, customers must have complained because <a href="http://mobilesyrup.com/2010/01/09/rogers-to-offer-htc-dream-owners-a-limited-time-opportunity-to-upgrade-to-magic/" target="_blank">MobileSyrup reported that Rogers is offering free upgrades to Dream owners up to a HTC Magic</a>. The only difference between the two really is that the Dream has a physical QWERTY keyboard (the Magic does not) and that the Magic has twice the RAM that the Dream does (512 to the Dream's 256, I believe). I don't think I can give up my keyboard though. Plus the screen is tiny enough as it is, a virtual keyboard taking up half of the screen wouldn't be desirable. Looks like I gotta take the hax0r route after all.

» <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/10/intel-shows-off-glasses-free-3d-demo-now-this-is-more-like-it/">Hey, look what Engadget found in Intel's CES booth!</a> 3D TV sans silly looking glasses! Although it seems you have to be looking at the screen at a certain angle for it to work, this is definitely a step in the right direction. I don't think many people want to wear 3D glasses in their homes.

» <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5439877/take-dramatic-photos-with-a-diy-drinking+straw-snoot" target="_blank">Lifehacker found this cool guide on how to take dramatic-looking photos using a neat trick with straws.</a> Definitely a trick I'll be using to reach my goal of becoming a male model.

» Two interesting articles from io9 this weekend. I love that site. Anyway, first off: LOST, an incredible TV series, may have it's veins sucked dry post-mortem .<a href="http://io9.com/5443393/lost-the-next-generation-could-be-on-its-way" target="_blank"> io9 reports that ABC/Disney is definitely interested in keeping the LOST franchise alive after the final season ends this May.</a> Hey, I'm all for it as long as it's a spin-off about Locke and his mysterious past as a box factory employee. How will that fit into the mystery? Oh, I'm sure we will see. Secondly,<a href="http://io9.com/5443390/would-living-forever-make-us-happier" target="_blank"> an interesting article about whether happiness would be possible if humans were immortal</a>. Science fiction author and philosopher (an interesting mix) Russell Blackford argues that we could be. An interesting argument, but I'm not sure where I stand on it yet.

» And to finish off, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/X24Qy.jpg" target="_blank">I leave you all with this image of Jesuscat</a>. Thank you, and goodnight!
