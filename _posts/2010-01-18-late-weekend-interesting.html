I have yet to get the hang of my schedule, so I am still having a little trouble with the whole 'time management' concept. Hopefully, I will have everything running 100% in a week or two. In the meantime, I will procrastinate writing any original content by posting links to some interesting stuff! Quite the linkdump here, so get your left-click fingers ready:

» IndieGames is quickly becoming one of my favorite sites to read. This time, two interesting articles from them. <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/01/feature_top_freeware_platforme.html" target="_blank">First off, we have a list of the Top 20 Free Platformers of 2009</a>. Three of my favorite things: a 'best of' list, platformer games, and free! For freeware indie games, some of these look mighty impressive. I have yet to try any out yet, hopefully when I have some free time I can. Secondly, another interesting list, <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/12/10_indie_games_to_watch_out_fo.html" target="_blank">this one previewing 10 indie games to be released in2010</a>. Boryokudan Rue looks very cool, and I've been waiting for Fez to be released since I first laid eyes upon it's beautiful pixel-style art, so it looks like 2010 will be an interesting year for the indie scene.

» Lifehacker has a link to guide on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5449792/build-a-lego-router" target="_blank">how to build a router made out of Lego</a>. Yes, a router made out of Lego. Oh, the things you can do with Lego. I'd like to see a fully functioning car made out of Lego, even if it has to be powered ala the Flintstones.

» Two very cool gadget-related articles from Engadget. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/14/next-gen-dashboards-get-tegra-2-moblin-atom-we-go-hands-on/" target="_blank">First off, this is what a computer in a car's dashboard SHOULD look like</a>. All sleek and shiny... I am just hoping you can't get internet access on that thing, or I can see the amount of car accidents caused by distraction going wayy up. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/18/misa-digital-guitar-cuts-the-strings-brings-the-noise/" target="_blank">Another very cool gadget is this digital string-less guitar</a>. Nothing says "I'm playing a guitar in the freakin' future!" like shredding on one of these babies. Personally, acoustic has always been the most pleasing on my ears.

» io9 was kind enough to <a href="http://io9.com/5450232/dissect-the-tenth-doctors-last-days" target="_blank">let their readers know that the scripts for the 2009 Doctor Who specials are now online</a>, so obsessed fans can dissect every line and every stage action to solve every last lingering secret surrounding the 10th Doctor. How kind of them...

... anyway... I just remembered I had to read... something. Bye!
