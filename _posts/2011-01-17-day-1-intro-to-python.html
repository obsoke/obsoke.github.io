I have been meaning to start learning Python for a while now but I did not have much time due to school. Now that I have time off, I decided it was worth taking a look at it.

Python is pretty different to what I am used to (which is C and C++). I hear it is very good at letting a programmer quickly create a prototype, and for light processing. It may not be the most efficient language in terms of speed (although it seems pretty quick to me, I have just heard it is not the best for large-scale applications) but it is incredibly easy to use.

Two resources I have been using for this is Mark Pilgrim's fantastic <a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Dive Into Python</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/">Google's Python Class</a>. The Google video lectures are actually quite good, as the exercises done in the lectures are available for download. By tomorrow, I should be able to code something small up. Until then, I'll continue to read/watch the material I found. My goal is to try to create a very simple game by the end of the week, most likely tic-tac-toe. I shall be back tomorrow with a progress update!
