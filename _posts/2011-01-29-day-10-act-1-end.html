Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to play around with SFML a bit more today. That is okay though, because I will have the whole month to read up on the documentation, as well as brushing up on my C++ skills. 

This is the last post I'll be making until the first weekday of March. During the next month, I will be attempting to master the use of my Nikon D90 DSLR camera, continue to work out and get into better shape, learn to cook a few neat things, and read as much as I can about programming and computer science. I am taking this break due to the repetitive strain injury I have developed in my hand since last March. Now that I have time off of school, I need to spend time off the computer so my hands will heal completely. Only then will I be able to fully immerse myself into a programming lifestyle of staying up all night, programming forever. Here are a few of the resources I will be looking at during my time off:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/">Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2008/">Introduction to Algorithms</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2005/">Mathematics for Computer Science</a></li>
</ul>
I hope everyone has a great February! See you in a month!
