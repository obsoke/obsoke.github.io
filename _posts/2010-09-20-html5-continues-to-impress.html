I came across <a href="http://www.phoboslab.org/biolab/">this game</a> completely done in HTML5 and JavaScript, and it really shows how powerful web technologies can be without the use of plug-ins. This really inspires me to learn more JS and to begin to learn HTML5.. keep up the good work, web gurus!
