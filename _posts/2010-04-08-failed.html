Now that I am entering the final stretch of my first semester in Computer Programming &amp; Analysis, it would seem that I actually have the time to make a blog post! Things have been quite busy but all I have left to do now is to finish coding my Sudoku puzzle generator (in C) and study for my final exams, school-wise. The middle part of this semester, as one could probably tell from the lack of posts, has kept me quite busy, and I'm adjusting to a quite different style of work than I am used to. No more long-winded essays! Oh, it feels quite good. What feels even better is that I really seem to enjoy programming. Granted, I have only been scratching  the surface of C, as well as have dabbled my feet in a little bit of Python, but so far I seem to be grasping it all quite quickly.

I'm actually going to be taking my second semester during the summer, so besides crossing my fingers that my school has a proper A/C system, I also plan to work on two little projects. The first one is to re-design this blog &amp; to complete the splash page located on the root of the domain. It will definitely not be as flashy or good-looking as the current design, but at least it will be one I created myself. I am taking a class where I will be learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript so it's pretty much like getting two birds stoned at once.

The second project is to code a simple game in C, using the SDL library. Right now, I am just thinking something like Tetris or Blockbreaker, just to learn the basics. After I get that done, I would like to add an interesting gameplay element to the game that makes it different from vanilla Blockbreaker/Tetris. I've been doing some brainstorming, as well as reading the documentation for SDL, so hopefully I can get started on that once my exams are complete.

So that is my plan. If you were wondering, the post title refers to the fact that it has been exactly two months since my last post, and how the first line of said post has me promising the opposite will happen... oops! Well, I never stop trying so I will continue to attempt to blog about possibly-interesting things. Until then...
