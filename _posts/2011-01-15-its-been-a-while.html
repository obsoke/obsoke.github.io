I haven't made a post since FSOSS, but there hasn't been much to say on my end. After four semesters straight, I have decided to take a break from school this semester. I will be starting the second half of my program in May, and hopefully doing a co-op semester in September.

Until then, I plan on using this time off to learn things I have been interested in for a while, such as game development, C#, PHP, Python, and computer science concepts. Starting next Monday, I plan on writing a blog entry each week day on what I've been reading about. I am hoping this keeps my mind active during the semester off, and I want to use my time productively! During February, I am taking a break from computers in general so there will be no blog posts.

I guess I'll be back on Monday with my first post! Until then, have a good weekend.
