Already a few days late, but I made it in the end... and isn't that what matters? Anyway, here are three days worth of stuff I found interesting while on the internets.

» <a href="http://www.critical-distance.com/2009/12/24/99-free-games-from-2009/" target="_blank">Game critic Christopher Hyde gives his two cents</a> as to what the best free games of 2009 were. Definitely interesting to see what indie game developers are coming up with although some, like <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/513760" target="_blank">Miami Shark</a>, are just ridiculous. Awesome, but still ridiculous. [via <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com" target="_blank">Gamasutra</a>]

» <a href="http://mobilesyrup.com/2010/01/06/wind-chatting-with-google-to-bring-nexus-one-to-canada/" target="_blank">Canadian cell phone site MobileSyrup reports that</a> WIND Mobile, the newest player in the Canadian telecom industry, may be the first to bring Google's new Nexus One phone to Canada. Hopefully this seemingly-fierce competition drives Rogers, Bell and Telus (especially Rogers though) to fight as hard to bring smartphones like the Nexus One up north. For some reason, I feel like that's wishful thinking on my part but hey, I can dream, amirite?

» io9 posted two articles I found quite interesting. Firstly, <a href="http://io9.com/5439138/figuring-out-doctor-whos-lingering-mysteries" target="_blank">they took a look at mysteries still unsolved in Doctor Who</a>. David Tennant's run as the Doctor is over but possible foreshadowing in 'The End of Time' may hint at some exciting things to come in series 5. Secondly, <a href="http://io9.com/5441214/brace-yourself-for-the-reboot-of-lost-five-years-from-now" target="_blank">the showrunners of Lost comment on future of the show after the series finale</a>. Will there be a Lost film five years after this May's final episode? A miniseries? Hell, even a reboot? A reboot would be too much, but as long as Lost doesn't pull a Battlestar Galactica in the end, I think I'd be happy returning to it's universe.

» Finally, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5441531/use-better-tools-to-be-a-better-student-in-2010" target="_blank">Lifehacker posted an article with tips on how to be a more productive student</a>. Definitely useful for university and college students heading back to school for the Winter semester this week.

That's all for today! I shall try to get that Doctor Who review up for Friday. Bye!
