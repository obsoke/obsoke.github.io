The weeks seem to fly by when you're in school. I used to wonder what people meant when they said time moves quicker the older you get, but now I think I do. The more you do, the more time is consumed and the less you have to just do things you want to do. It's Monday... and the next thing you know, it's somehow the weekend. How depressing! 
I've had a few personal issues pop up, preventing me from working on the game club or doing any recreational programming. However, it has not stopped me from browsing the Internets! So, making it's triumphant return... interesting links I've come across!

» Using PuTTY on Windows? Feeling underwhelmed by its lack of features? I found a cool, more feature-rich alternative called <a href="http://kitty.9bis.com/">KiTTY</a>. Check it out if you're interested in a new SSH client.

» Endgadget posted an interesting article on the quality of life of Foxconn employees. Foxconn manufactures many of the parts used in commercial tech products, such as the iPhone. It seems like that huge amounts of cash generated by these products never reach the people who actually work to create the physical product. Capitalism at work! Check out the article <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/19/the-fate-of-a-generation-of-workers-foxconn-undercover-fully-tr/">here</a>.

» To end this post with a horrifying note... What would Doctor Who be like if it was created by Disney? <a href="http://io9.com/5542241/what-if-doctor-who-were-a-disney-movie">Click here</a> for a glimpse into some sick, twisted alternate reality where that seems to be the case. 

Alright, that's all I've got for now.
