By the time my first day in my second semester in CPA ended, I had a feeling that this semester would be much more interesting than the last. By the end of the week, I was sure of it. Although two of my classes deal with an operating system completely new to me (System i on an IBM Power Systems) and so far seem very cryptic and almost intimidating, my C++ and HTML/CSS/JS classes seem like they will be a lot of fun. Also, I really want to learn more C++, CSS and JavaScript, as I see learning these as relevant to things I would like to do, while learning some business OS for writing business applications... not so interesting yet. At least all my teachers seem pretty cool so far.

Speaking of school, I've gotten around to setting up a temporary site for the <a href="http://gamedev.dkxy.net">'Unofficial' Seneca Game Design & Development Club</a>! I'm currently hosting it on a subdomain until I get the sense that it is serious enough for a full domain. I really hope that people join this summer, as I would like to begin to work on my game programming skills just with something simple. Perhaps Tetris or Brickbreaker with a twist. <em><a href="http://www.shattergame.com/">Shatter</a></em> is an awesome example of how you can take an old idea and execute it into something new and fun, and I don't think it would be too difficult to come up with something along these lines. I guess I'll have to wait and see how the next few weeks go.

There really is not enough time in the day to do everything I would like to. Aside from studying & recreational programming, I've been addicted to HBO's <em>Six Feet Under</em>. The combination of dark and light humour, plus the incredible writing and hilarious dream sequences definitely make this one of the best shows I've had the pleasure to watch. I don't know how HBO does it, but they really know how to pick amazing shows to broadcast. This definitely gives me high hopes for the upcoming television adaptation of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>.

Lastly, I ordered <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the newest game by Rockstar. It looks like a mix between <em>Deadwood</em> and <em>GTA4</em>... which is awesome. I should be getting it either tomorrow or Wednesday. Hopefully I have time to play it in between school and everything else. Who else is for extending the amount of hours in a day to 48? ....anyone?
