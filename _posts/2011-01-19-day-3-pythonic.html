So I learned three things today:

<ol>
<li>I bet you are asking yourself "If whitespace plays such an important role in Python's syntax, how can a statement span multiple lines?" Simple! Just enclose the entire, line-spanning statement with parentheses (or curly braces, or square brackets! Just be consistent with which one you use for the sake of the others who might read your code). 
</li>
<li>Apparently Python does not have incrementation operators, which I find strange for a language which seems to make it as easy for you to code as possible.
</li>
<li>PyGame is built around the SDL library. I never knew that... neat.</li>
</ol>

I have been coding a lot with the Google exercises today; I want to be comfortable with the language before I start to try making games with it. I need to re-read some chapters and re-watch a few videos before I get the hang of it... I expect to be doing a lot of coding this weekend!
