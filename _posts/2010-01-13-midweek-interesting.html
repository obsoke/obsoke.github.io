It has been a busy week! I started Computer Programming &amp; Analysis Monday and while things haven't seem to really gotten started yet, I feel like I am going to enjoy this program a lot. That makes me happy. There are a ton of things I found interesting since Sunday though, so here we go:

» <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/" target="_blank">foobar2000 finally hit 1.0</a>. I can't believe it, that program was stuck in 'beta' hell! It's my favorite music player for Windows, as it plays nearly every audio format out-of-the-box and is incredibly customizable and light-weight... my favorite qualities in a program!

» <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-10431741-71.html" target="_blank">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg believes users do not want privacy online because that's the current social norm. </a>That's right, folks, Facebook defines what's cool and what ain't these days, and clearly privacy is NOT cool. Amirite?

» <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O4rNB.jpg" target="_blank">This made me laugh hysterically for a minute or two</a>. Iron Maiden? Excellent! Oh, how I love thee, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure.

»<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5445101/your-passwords-arent-as-secure-as-you-think-heres-how-to-fix-that" target="_blank"> Lifehacker posted an interesting article on how your passwords may not be as secure as you think</a>, and how to fix that problem. A good read for anyone paranoid about being haxed.

» <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/01/nyt-sarah-palin-to-become-paid-fox-news-contributor/1" target="_blank">Sarah Palin is in talks with FOX News to become a 'contributor'</a>, whatever that means. Is anyone really surprised by this?

... unfortunately, my web host is being quite unreliable and I just lost the other 3/4 of this post. Oh well, I can't be arsed enough to re-write it all. Night!
