Unfortunately, procrastination ate my Doctor Who - "End of Time" review. Perhaps I'll have it done by the end of the weekend? At least I have a bunch of interesting links to share, so everyone can procrastinate! Hoorah, procrastination!

» <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5443156/android-21s-best-features-in-screenshots" target="_blank">Lifehacker compiled a list of Android 2.1's best features</a>, so I can add even more reasons why I hate Rogers to my list. Unfortunately, unless I root it, my HTC Dream will be stuck with Android 1.5.

»<a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/01/Why-you-should-use-OpenGL-and-not-DirectX" target="_blank"> Indie game developers Wolfire posted an interesting article</a> on why OpenGL should be used instead of DirectX as the API-of-choice for games. I don't know too much about either, so it was an educational read for me.

» <a href="http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/ob/cera_faces_final.jpg" target="_blank">Cracked Magazine's online site posted this hilarious picture</a> depicting the acting range of Michael Cera. I loved him in Arrested Development but he really needs to try something new. I guess what he does now pays the bills (and more) so I doubt he is complaining.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IzuDMAiyFI" target="_blank"></a>

» <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IzuDMAiyFI" target="_blank">YouTube user TotemX made this awesome animation of Super Mario Jesus</a>. Yes, you read that right. A work of genius or the result of boredom? Either way, I found it pretty cool.

» <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/08/studio-xps-16-oled-concept-laptop-hands-on" target="_blank">At CES, Engadget took a look at Dell's new Studio XPS 16</a> with an OLED display, and man is it fine. Of course, pictures do not do it justice, but the specs are absolutely ridiculous. I hope this technology makes it into televisions ASAP!

» <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26643/Analysis_The_Conundrum_of_Final_Fantasy_XIII.php" target="_blank">Game industry site Gamasutra took a critical look at Final Fantasy 13</a>, and why it may be missing the 'G' in 'RPG'. I'll definitely be getting this game but it's disappointing that Square Enix has essentially dumbed down the game for a wider audience. Ah well, at least it looks better than Final Fantasy 12, right?

» And finally, <a href="http://www.movieline.com/2010/01/exclusive-disney-actually-is-developing-lost-ride.php" target="_blank">MovieLine reports that a LOST-themed ride may be appearing at a Disney theme park sometime soon</a>, meaning I will finally have to drag my ass to Florida or California (or Hong Kong) so I can ride a smoke monster into the hatch before it explodes. Oh man, that would be sweet.

That's quite the list of links, if I do say so myself. That's all, folks.
