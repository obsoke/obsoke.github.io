In every relationship, communication is a key aspect. A lot of activity has been taking place on IRC, and while I love IRC,
it isn't a great communication tool unless you are actively at your computer. Therefore, I've decided to set up a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/osdwebvtt)
so we can all communicate with each other. Hopefully, this will help organize our efforts in working towards implementing WebVTT into Firefox!
