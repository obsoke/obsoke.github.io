After a much-needed break, I have returned to school for yet another summer semester. It is going to be a tough and busy semester, which leaves less time for me to enjoy the beautiful weather we have been having in Toronto. As long as I can code, I'll be okay though!

I still have RSI in my hands, wrists and forearms, yet it is much better than it was in January. I no longer feel constant pain (or any pain at all), however the tightness in the hands and forearms is still present. I have had to stop PC gaming and I feel I won't be able to start again until feel I have healed enough. I want to spend all the hand-power I have left on coding! To help ease the RSI, I've recently ordered a new mouse, the <a href="http://www.evoluent.com/vm4r.htm">Evoluent VerticalMouse 4</a>. This mouse has gotten great reviews from people with similar experiences so I am hoping it helps me as well. I'm also looking into buying a comfortable chair. I am currently using some cheap chair from Staple's in-house brand, which isn't very comfortable when sitting for a long period of time.

I now have a separate blog specifically for game development at <a href="http://dalemakesgames.com">dalemakesgames.com</a>. This blog will continue to be used for personal, software development, and whatever I happen to have on my mind at the time.

That's all I have to say for now. Stay tuned for more blog posts in the near future!
