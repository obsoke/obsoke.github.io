I've been using Workrave for a bit over a month now so I wanted to post a quick follow-up. While very annoying at first, the frequent breaks are something I've gotten used to. The big question is: have I noticed any change in regards to RSI strain and pain? I haven't, but I see that as a good thing. I haven't got any worse at least! Stretching during my long breaks also helps relieve any tension I am feeling.

Obviously using a break timer isn't going to be some mirale cure for RSI, but I think it will definitely aid in my recovery and, later on, preventing me from straining myself again. I found <a href="http://www.handhealthresources.com/Solutions%20Pages/Exercises.htm" target="_blank">a great site</a> with stretches and excercises that I've been using, as well as doing about 15-20 minutes of cardio a day. I hope that frequent breaks + stretching + cardio + excercise will do the trick... because if that doesn't, I'm not sure what will!

I'll probably be posting these RSI updates every month or so, just as a way to personally journal my progress, as well as possibly informing others who may be in a similar situation.
