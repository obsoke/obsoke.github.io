Alright, so sue me. It has been a few months since my only (&amp; quite lonely) post was written. I'm sorry for neglecting you, blog. You had barely a taste of life before it was all taken away from you. Can you find it in your bloggy heart to forgive me? ...you can? Well then, time to get started! No more procrastination, no more unkept deadlines; let's get this started!

...starting tomorrow!
