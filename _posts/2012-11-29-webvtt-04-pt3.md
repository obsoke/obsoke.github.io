### Docs Ain't Easy
I have discovered something new about myself: it is much easier to write code than
to document it. I think I need to spend a little more time getting familiar with the
code base. How can one document something if they don't completely understand it?
Very poorly. I won't have a gh-page of substance to show in class tomorrow
(or rather, today) but I'm still hoping to get some feedback on what kind of site
we want: simple and single page vs. complex and multi-page.

### The Story So Far
After Humph mentioned [gource](http://code.google.com/p/gource/) during Monday's class,
I was interested to see what our progress so far would look like. So for your viewing pleasure,
I present to you libwebvtt: The Story So Far...

I thought creating this video would be a simple but things rarely are. I had trouble producing a video using the x264 codec
in an mp4 container so I decided to try WebM as my video codec. I had to re-install ffmpeg with homebrew to support libvpx, 
the VP8 Codec SDK. Then I had to play around with the gource flags until I got something that worked. man pages ftw! This
is the command I ended up using to generate the above video:

```
gource --title "libwebvtt" --key --auto-skip-sseconds 2 --multi-sampling --start-position 0.01 --hide "progress,mouse" -1920x1080 -0 - | ffmpeg -y -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libvpx -b:a 10000K gource.webm
```
